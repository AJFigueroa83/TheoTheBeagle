        <h2 class="BIO">BIO</h2>
        <p class="BIO">Theo was born on November 20, 2020 in Missouri.</p>
        <p class="BIO">He is the runt of his litter and had some mild complications during birth. He was born with a soft spot on his head which meant he had to be carefully watched so that he wouldn't get hit in that area.</p>
        <p class="BIO">His breeders made sure to take very good care of him. Infact, when my wife and I wanted to give Theo (then called Mickey Mouse) a permanent loving home, the breeder said they would not part ways with him until they were sure that he was 100% healthy.</p>
        <p class="BIO">So, after waiting for about 8 weeks we were finally given the clearance to take Theo home with us and he has been a part of our family since January 29, 2021 in Savannah, Georgia. Here you can learn more of his day to day life as a member of the Figueroa family.</p>
